WITHOUT RASPBERRY PI
This project runs retro games on a raspberry pi 2 with Emulation Station/RetroPie installed on it.

--CONTROLLER SETUP--

(This portion is optinal, you can simply use a controller plugged in by USB)
The controller is made from an Arduino Micro and portions of an N64 controller and the joystick from a GameCube controller. You can also use regular tactile switches and any joystick from a controller or purchased from a website such as SparkFun. For controller code and circuit diagram please refer to the docs folder of this repository. 

-- CABINET SETUP --

(This portion is optinal, you can hook the Raspberry Pi up to an external display, for example a TV or computer monitor.)
To make the cabinet you will need a piece of 3/4 inch plywood atleast 4' by 4'. This wood will be used for the side panels and most of the face panels. You will need 6 feet of 3 inch thick solid wood for edging and for the display panel. 1/4 inch plywood will be used for the control panel due to the buttons need a thin material to be able to easily be pressed, 1/4 inch panel will also be used for the bottom paneling. The display that is used in this project can be purchased at the following link. http://www.element14.com/community/docs/DOC-78156/l/raspberry-pi-7-touchscreen-display
